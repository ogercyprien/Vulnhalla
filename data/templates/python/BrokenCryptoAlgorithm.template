This analysis detects usage of Weak Cryptographic Algorithms.
1. What cryptographic algorithm is being used (MD5, SHA1, DES, RC4, etc.)?
2. What is the purpose of the hashing/encryption (password storage, data integrity, secure communication, non-security ID generation)?
3. If MD5/SHA1 is used, is it for security purposes (like signatures) or non-security purposes (like file dedup, cache keys)?
4. Is `usedforsecurity=False` passed to the hash constructor (if supported)?
5. Is the algorithm considered weak for the specific use case?
Use the tools to determine the algorithm and its application context.
If weak algorithms are used for non-security purposes, it is likely safe.
Only if weak algorithms are used for security-critical functions (passwords, signatures, encryption) is it a vulnerability!
