This analysis detects XML Bomb (Billion Laughs Attack).
1. Is XML being parsed?
2. Are DTDs disabled?
3. Is `lxml` or `xml.etree` used?
4. Is `defusedxml` used?
5. Can an attacker supply a malicious XML payload?
Use the tools to check the XML parser settings.
If DTDs are forbidden or `defusedxml` is used, it is safe.
Only if insecure parsers process untrusted XML is it a vulnerability!
