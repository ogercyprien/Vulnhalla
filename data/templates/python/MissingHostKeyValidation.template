This analysis detects Missing Host Key Validation in SSH connections.
1. Is `paramiko` or similar SSH library used?
2. Is `set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())` called?
3. Is `verify=False` passed to SSH connect methods?
4. Is this a development script or production code?
Use the tools to check the SSH client configuration.
If strict host key checking is enforced, it is safe.
Only if `AutoAddPolicy` or equivalent is used in production (MITM risk) is it a vulnerability!
