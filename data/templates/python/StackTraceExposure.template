This analysis detects Stack Trace Exposure.
1. Is an exception being caught?
2. Is the stack trace printed to the HTTP response or log?
3. Is `debug=True` enabled in production?
4. Can an attacker trigger an error to see the trace?
Use the tools to check the exception handling.
If the trace is logged internally, it is safe.
Only if the stack trace is revealed to the user in production is it a vulnerability!
