This analysis detects unsafe deserialization of user-controlled data.
1. Is the data being deserialized coming from an untrusted source?
2. What library is used for deserialization (pickle, yaml, marshal, etc.)?
3. If using `yaml`, is `SafeLoader` or `safe_load` used?
4. If using `pickle`, is there any cryptographic signature validation of the data before deserialization?
5. Can an attacker control the content of the serialized object?
Use the tools to identify the deserialization method and the source of the data.
If `yaml.safe_load` is used, it is generally safe. `pickle` on untrusted data is almost always unsafe.
Only if untrusted data is deserialized using an unsafe method is it a vulnerability!
