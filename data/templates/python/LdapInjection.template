This analysis detects potential LDAP Injection vulnerabilities.
1. Is the LDAP query constructed using user-controlled input?
2. Is the user input properly sanitized or escaped before being included in the query?
3. What library is used for LDAP operations? Does it provide parameterized queries?
4. Can an attacker modify the structure of the LDAP filter (e.g., introducing new conditions)?
5. Is the input validated against an allowlist?
Use the tools to trace the data flow to the LDAP query execution.
If the input is properly escaped (e.g., using `ldap.filter.escape_filter_chars`) or parameterized, it is likely safe.
Only if untrusted input is directly concatenated into the LDAP filter string is it a vulnerability!
