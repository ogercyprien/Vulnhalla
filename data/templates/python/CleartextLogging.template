This analysis detects Cleartext Logging of Sensitive Information.
1. What information is being logged (password, token, credit card, PII)?
2. Is the variable name misleading (e.g., "password" variable actually holding a hash)?
3. Is the data masked, redacted, or hashed before logging?
4. Is this a debug log that is disabled in production?
5. Is the data actually sensitive in this context?
Use the tools to inspect the content of the logged variable.
If the data is not sensitive or is properly masked, it is a false positive.
Only if actual sensitive data is written to logs in cleartext is it a vulnerability!
