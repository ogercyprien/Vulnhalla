This analysis detects Cookie Injection.
1. Is a cookie value being set using user-controlled input?
2. Is the input validated or sanitized to prevent injecting attributes (e.g., `; Secure; HttpOnly`)?
3. Can an attacker overwrite critical cookie flags?
4. Is the framework's secure cookie setting function used?
Use the tools to trace the cookie setting logic.
If the input is validated or the framework handles cookie serialization safely, it is likely safe.
Only if raw string concatenation is used to build Set-Cookie headers is it a vulnerability!
