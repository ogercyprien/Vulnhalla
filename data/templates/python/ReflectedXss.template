This analysis detects potential Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
1. Is the data being reflected back to the user coming from an HTTP request or other untrusted source?
2. Is the data sanitized or escaped before being included in the response (e.g., HTML escaping)?
3. What context is the data being output to (HTML body, attribute, JavaScript, etc.)?
4. Does the framework provide automatic escaping (like Jinja2 with autoescape=True)? Is it enabled?
5. Is the Content-Type header set to text/html?
Use the tools to trace the data flow and check for escaping mechanisms.
If the data is properly escaped for the output context, it is likely safe.
Only if untrusted data is output directly to the browser without escaping is it a vulnerability!
