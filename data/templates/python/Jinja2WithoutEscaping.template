This analysis detects Jinja2 templates without Auto-Escaping.
1. Is the Jinja2 environment configured with `autoescape=False` or `autoescape=None`?
2. Are user-controlled variables rendered in the template?
3. Is `|safe` filter used on untrusted data?
4. Is the output HTML?
Use the tools to check the Jinja2 environment configuration.
If `autoescape=True` (default in Flask) or the content type is not HTML, it is likely safe.
Only if auto-escaping is disabled for HTML output with untrusted data is it a vulnerability!
