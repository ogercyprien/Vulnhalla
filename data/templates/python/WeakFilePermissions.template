This analysis detects Weak File Permissions.
1. Is `os.chmod` used?
2. Are permissions set to `0o777` (world-writable)?
3. Is `umask` used correctly?
4. Is the file sensitive (config, key, executable)?
5. Is this a temporary file that should be private?
Use the tools to check the permission bits.
If permissions are restrictive (e.g., `0o600` for keys), it is safe.
Only if sensitive files are made world-readable/writable is it a vulnerability!
