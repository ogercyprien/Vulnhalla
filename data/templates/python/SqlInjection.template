This analysis detects potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
1. Is the data entering the SQL query user-controlled? Trace the data flow back to its source.
2. Is the user input properly sanitized or parameterized before being used in the query?
3. If string formatting or concatenation is used, is it safe? (e.g., using a library that handles escaping)
4. Is the query structure modified by user input in a way that allows injection?
5. Can the user input manipulate the SQL logic? (yes/no)
Use the tools to trace the variable back to its definition.
If the input is properly parameterized or validated against an allowlist, it is likely safe.
Only if user input is directly concatenated or formatted into the query without sanitization is it a vulnerability!
