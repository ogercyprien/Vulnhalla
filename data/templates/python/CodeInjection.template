This analysis detects potential Code Injection vulnerabilities.
1. Is the code being executed constructed using user-controlled input?
2. What function is used to execute the code (eval, exec, compile, etc.)?
3. Is the input properly validated or sanitized to ensure it contains only expected values?
4. Can an attacker inject arbitrary Python code?
5. Is the input limited to a safe subset of the language (e.g., using `ast.literal_eval` instead of `eval`)?
Use the tools to trace the input to the execution function.
If the input is strictly validated or `ast.literal_eval` is used for data parsing, it is likely safe.
Only if untrusted input is passed to `eval`, `exec`, or similar functions allows arbitrary code execution!
