This analysis detects Requests without Validation.
1. Is an HTTP request (urllib, requests) made?
2. Is SSL verification disabled (`verify=False`)?
3. Is the URL user-controlled?
Use the tools to check the request parameters.
If SSL verification is enabled (default), it is safe.
Only if verification is disabled or the URL is untrusted (SSRF) is it a vulnerability!
