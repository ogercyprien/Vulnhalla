This analysis detects Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information.
1. What data is being stored (password, API key, credit card)?
2. Where is it being stored (local file, database, cookie)?
3. Is it encrypted or hashed before storage?
4. Is this a test or mock environment?
Use the tools to trace the data to the storage function.
If the data is not sensitive or is encrypted, it is safe.
Only if credentials or PII are stored in cleartext is it a vulnerability!
