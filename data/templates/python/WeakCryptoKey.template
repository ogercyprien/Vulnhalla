This analysis detects Weak Crypto Keys.
1. Is a cryptographic key being generated?
2. Is the key length sufficient (e.g., RSA < 2048, AES < 128)?
3. Is `os.urandom` or `secrets` module used for key generation?
4. Is a hardcoded value used as a key?
Use the tools to check the key generation parameters.
If standard key sizes and secure RNGs are used, it is safe.
Only if short keys or predictable values are used is it a vulnerability!
