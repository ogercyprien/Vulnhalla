This analysis detects ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service).
1. Analyze the regex pattern. Does it have overlapping repetitions?
2. Is the input string user-controlled?
3. Is there a length limit on the input?
4. Is the regex used in a loop?
Use the tools to inspect the regex and input.
If the regex is safe or the input is short, it is safe.
Only if a vulnerable regex matches unbounded user input is it a vulnerability!
