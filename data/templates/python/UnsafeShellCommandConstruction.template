This analysis detects Unsafe Shell Command Construction.
1. Is a command string built using user-controlled input?
2. Is `shell=True` used in `subprocess`?
3. Is `os.system` or `os.popen` used?
4. Is the input quoted using `shlex.quote()`?
Use the tools to check the command construction.
If arguments are passed as a list or input is quoted, it is safe.
Only if untrusted strings are concatenated into a shell command is it a vulnerability!
