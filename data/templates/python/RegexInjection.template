This analysis detects Regex Injection.
1. Is a regex built using user-controlled input?
2. Is the input escaped (`re.escape()`)?
3. Can an attacker modify the regex structure (e.g., insert group operators)?
4. Is this intentional (e.g., a regex tester app)?
Use the tools to trace the regex construction.
If the input is escaped, it is safe.
Only if untrusted input changes the regex logic is it a vulnerability!
