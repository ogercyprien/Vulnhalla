This analysis detects Overly Large Ranges (DoS risk).
1. Is `range()` or `xrange()` called with a user-controlled value?
2. Is the value capped or validated?
3. Is the result of the range used in a memory-intensive way (e.g., `list(range(...))`)?
4. Is it just an iterator (Python 3 range) or a list (Python 2 range)?
5. Can an attacker trigger a MemoryError or significant CPU consumption?
Use the tools to trace the input to the range function.
If the input is small or capped, it is safe.
Only if an attacker can induce a massive allocation or loop count is it a vulnerability!
