This analysis detects XPath Injection.
1. Is an XPath query constructed using user-controlled input?
2. Is string concatenation used?
3. Are parameters used instead?
4. Is the XML structure predictable?
Use the tools to trace the XPath query construction.
If the query structure is static or input is sanitized, it is safe.
Only if untrusted input can modify the XPath logic is it a vulnerability!
