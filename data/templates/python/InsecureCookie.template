This analysis detects Insecure Cookie configuration.
1. Are `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite` flags set on the cookie?
2. Is the cookie sensitive (session ID, auth token)?
3. Is `Secure=False` or `HttpOnly=False` explicitly set?
4. Is the application served over HTTPS?
Use the tools to check the cookie attributes.
If the cookie is non-sensitive (e.g., UI preference), missing flags are less critical.
Only if session cookies are missing Secure/HttpOnly flags is it a vulnerability!
