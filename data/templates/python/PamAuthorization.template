This analysis detects unsafe PAM Authorization.
1. Is `pam` module used?
2. Is `authenticate()` called without creating a session?
3. Is `acct_mgmt()` called? (It is required for correct PAM authorization)
4. Is the return code checked properly?
Use the tools to check the PAM call sequence.
If `acct_mgmt` is called after `authenticate`, it is likely safe.
Only if `authenticate` is used alone (skipping account validity checks) is it a vulnerability!
