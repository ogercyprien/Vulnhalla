This analysis detects potential Log Injection (Log Forging) vulnerabilities.
1. Is the log message constructed using user-controlled input?
2. Is the input sanitized to remove newline characters (`\n`, `\r`)?
3. Can an attacker inject new log entries by inserting newlines?
4. Is the logging library configured to handle newlines safely?
5. Is the input validated?
Use the tools to trace the data flow to the logging call.
If the input is sanitized or the logger escapes newlines, it is likely safe.
Only if untrusted input containing newlines is written directly to logs is it a vulnerability!
