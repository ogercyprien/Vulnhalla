This analysis detects potential TarSlip (ZipSlip) vulnerabilities.
1. Is the archive (tar/zip) being extracted coming from an untrusted source?
2. Does the code validate the destination path of each extracted member?
3. Is `os.path.commonprefix` or similar logic used to ensure the extracted file lies within the target directory?
4. Is the code using `tarfile.extractall` without a `filter='data'` argument (Python 3.12+ safe default)?
5. Can an attacker write files outside the intended directory via ".." in filenames?
Use the tools to check the extraction loop and path validation.
If the paths are validated or a safe extraction filter is used, it is likely safe.
Only if files are extracted without checking for directory traversal is it a vulnerability!
