This analysis detects Bad Tag Filter usage.
1. Is the filter attempting to remove dangerous HTML tags (e.g., <script>)?
2. Is it a blocklist approach (listing bad tags)? Blocklists are easily bypassed.
3. Is the input parsed correctly before filtering?
4. Can an attacker obfuscate tags (e.g., `<SCR IPT>`) to bypass the filter?
Use the tools to inspect the filtering logic.
If it's a blocklist-based filter on raw strings, it is likely vulnerable.
Only if it's a robust allowlist-based sanitizer (like Bleach) is it safe.
