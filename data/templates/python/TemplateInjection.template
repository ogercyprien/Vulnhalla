This analysis detects Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI).
1. Is a template rendered from a string (not a file)?
2. Is user-controlled input concatenated into the template string before rendering?
3. Is `jinja2.Template(user_input)` used?
4. Can an attacker inject template syntax (e.g., `{{ 7*7 }}`)?
Use the tools to trace the template source.
If user input is passed as context variables, it is safe.
Only if user input is concatenated into the template string itself is it a vulnerability!
