This analysis detects potential Path Injection (Path Traversal) vulnerabilities.
1. Is the file path being accessed constructed using user-controlled input?
2. Is there validation to ensure the path remains within the intended directory (e.g., checking for ".." or absolute paths)?
3. Is the user input sanitized to remove directory traversal characters?
4. Is the path normalized (e.g., using `os.path.abspath` or `os.path.realpath`) before validation?
5. Can an attacker read or write arbitrary files on the system?
Use the tools to trace the path construction and validation logic.
If the path is validated against an allowlist or strictly confined to a safe directory, it is likely safe.
Only if user input allows traversing outside the intended directory is it a vulnerability!
