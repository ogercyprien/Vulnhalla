This analysis detects Non-HTTPOnly Cookie.
1. Is a sensitive cookie (session ID, auth token) being set?
2. Is `httponly=False` explicitly set?
3. Is `httponly` missing (defaults often False in standard library, True in frameworks)?
4. Does client-side JavaScript *need* to access this cookie?
Use the tools to check the cookie attributes.
If the cookie is not sensitive or JS access is required and safe, it is a false positive.
Only if session cookies are accessible to JS (XSS risk) is it a vulnerability!
