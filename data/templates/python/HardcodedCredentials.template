This analysis detects Hardcoded Credentials.
1. Is the highlighted string actually a credential (password, API key, secret, token)?
2. Is it a placeholder, example, or test value (e.g., "password", "123456", "test")?
3. Is the value used for authentication or authorization?
4. Is it a configuration default that is meant to be overridden?
5. Is the code part of a test file or example script?
Use the tools to examine the context of the variable usage.
If the value is a placeholder, test data, or non-sensitive configuration, it is a false positive.
Only if a real secret is hardcoded in production code is it a vulnerability!
