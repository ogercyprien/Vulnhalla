This analysis detects Insecure Temporary File creation.
1. Is `mktemp` used (deprecated and unsafe)?
2. Is `tempfile.mktemp()` used?
3. Is there a race condition between file name generation and creation?
4. Are safe alternatives like `tempfile.mkstemp()`, `NamedTemporaryFile`, or `TemporaryDirectory` used?
Use the tools to check the temp file function.
If `mkstemp` or higher-level safe wrappers are used, it is safe.
Only if `mktemp` is used is it a vulnerability (race condition)!
