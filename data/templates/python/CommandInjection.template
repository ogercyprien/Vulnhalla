This analysis detects potential Command Injection vulnerabilities.
1. Is the command being executed constructed using user-controlled input?
2. Trace the input source. Is it from an untrusted source (e.g., HTTP request, user input)?
3. Is the input properly sanitized or validated before being used in the command?
4. Is the command executed using a shell (shell=True in subprocess) or a function that invokes a shell?
5. Are arguments properly quoted or passed as a list to avoid shell interpretation?
Use the tools to check the data flow and the execution context.
If the input is validated or passed as a separate argument to a non-shell execution, it is likely safe.
Only if user input is directly concatenated into a shell command string is it a vulnerability!
